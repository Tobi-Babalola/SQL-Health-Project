# SQL-Health-Project
*Exploring the Drivers of Healthcare Costs (SQL + Power BI Analysis)*

### **Project Overview**
> This project explores healthcare charges using SQL and Power BI. The analysis examines how factors such as smoking status, BMI, age, children, and region influence medical charges. The goal is to uncover drivers of high costs and highlight patient groups most affected.

---

### **Dataset**
The dataset was acquired from Kaggle (titled "Medical Insurance Cost Dataset")
The main columns: *age, gender, BMI, children, smoker, region, charges*.

---

### **Tools Used**
* **SQL (MySQL Workbench)** – for cleaning, querying, and analysis.
* **Power BI** – for visualization and storytelling.

---

### **Key Questions Explored**
* How do smoking habits impact medical charges?
* Do BMI categories (underweight, normal, overweight, obese) influence charges?
* Which regions show higher average medical costs?
* Do families with more children have higher charges?
* Who are the top 10 highest-cost patients and what traits do they share?

---

### **Insights & Findings**
* **Smokers** pay ~3x more on average than non-smokers.
* **Obese patients** are the largest outliers.
* **Region** plays a role but is less significant than lifestyle factors.
* **Number of children** doesn’t strongly affect charges.

---

### **Conclusion**
> This analysis demonstrates how lifestyle factors like smoking and BMI have the largest impact on healthcare costs. Such insights can help insurance companies, healthcare providers, and policymakers in better cost prediction and preventive healthcare strategies.
