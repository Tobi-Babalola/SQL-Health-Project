# SQL-Health-Project
*Exploring the Drivers of Healthcare Costs (SQL + Power BI Analysis)*

### **Project Overview**

> This project explores healthcare charges using SQL and Power BI. The analysis examines how factors such as smoking status, BMI, age, children, and region influence medical charges. The goal is to uncover drivers of high costs and highlight patient groups most affected.

### **Dataset**
The dataset was acquired from Kaggle (titled "Medical Insurance Cost Dataset")
The main columns: *age, gender, BMI, children, smoker, region, charges*.

### **Tools Used**

* **SQL (MySQL Workbench)** – for cleaning, querying, and analysis.
* **Power BI** – for visualization and storytelling.

---

### 5. **Key Questions Explored**

List the guiding research questions:

* How do smoking habits impact medical charges?
* Do BMI categories (underweight, normal, overweight, obese) influence charges?
* Which regions show higher average medical costs?
* Do families with more children have higher charges?
* What does the distribution of charges look like (are costs evenly spread)?
* Who are the top 10 highest-cost patients and what traits do they share?

---

### 6. **Insights & Findings**

Summarize the highlights (based on your charts):

* **Smokers** pay ~3x more on average than non-smokers.
* **Obese patients** have the highest median charges and more outliers.
* **Medical charges are highly skewed**, with a few extreme cases driving up the average.
* **Region** plays a role but less significant than lifestyle factors.
* **Number of children** doesn’t strongly affect charges.

---

### 7. **Visualizations**

* Include screenshots of your Power BI dashboard (like the one you shared).
* Mention each chart briefly (e.g., *“Boxplot of Charges by BMI group reveals outliers among obese patients.”*).

---

### 8. **How to Reproduce**

* Steps to run the SQL queries (import CSV, create table, run scripts).
* How to open the `.pbix` Power BI file.
* Any requirements (e.g., MySQL Workbench, Power BI Desktop).

---

### 9. **Conclusion**

* Wrap it up with a big-picture statement.
  Example:

> This analysis demonstrates how lifestyle factors like smoking and BMI have the largest impact on healthcare costs. Such insights can help insurance companies, healthcare providers, and policymakers in better cost prediction and preventive healthcare strategies.

### 🔹 Optional Sections

* **Future Work** (e.g., predictive modeling in Python, deeper SQL analysis).
* **References** (dataset link, research papers, blog inspiration).
